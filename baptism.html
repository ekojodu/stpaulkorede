						<h2>BAPTISM - Baptized in Love, Embraced by Faith</h2>
						<p>
							Baptism holds a profound significance within the Catholic Church,
							serving as the sacrament of initiation that marks the beginning of
							a person's Christian journey and membership in the Church. Baptism
							in the Catholic Church is a sacred sacrament that initiates
							individuals into the Christian faith, cleanses them from sin, and
							incorporates them into the Church community. It is a profound
							expression of God's saving love and the beginning of a lifelong
							journey of discipleship and mission.
						</p>
						<h2>Meaning and Purpose</h2>
						<p>Baptism is understood in Catholic theology as:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Sacrament of Initiation: Baptism is the first of the three
								sacraments of initiation (alongside Confirmation and Eucharist),
								through which a person becomes a member of the Christian
								community.
							</li>

							<li>
								Cleansing and Renewal: Baptism signifies the cleansing of
								original sin (in the case of infants) and personal sins (in the
								case of adults), bringing about spiritual rebirth and renewal by
								the Holy Spirit.
							</li>
							<li>
								Incorporation into Christ: Baptism incorporates the baptized
								person into the mystical body of Christ, making them a part of
								the Church, which is the body of Christ on earth.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h2>Biblical Basis</h2>

						<p>
							The Catholic Church draws its understanding of baptism from
							biblical teachings:
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								Jesus' Example: Jesus himself was baptized by John the Baptist
								in the Jordan River (Matthew 3:13-17), establishing the
								importance of baptism.
							</li>
							<li>
								Nicodemus Dialogue: Jesus' dialogue with Nicodemus highlights
								the necessity of being born of water and the Spirit (John 3:5),
								pointing to the sacramental nature of baptism.
							</li>

							<li>
								Great Commission: Jesus commanded his disciples to baptize all
								nations in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew
								28:19-20), emphasizing the universal nature of baptism.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Sacramental Rite</h2>

						<p>
							The Catholic Church administers baptism through specific rites:
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								Water and the Trinitarian Formula: Baptism is typically
								performed by pouring water over the person's head or through
								immersion, accompanied by the Trinitarian formula ("I baptize
								you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
								Spirit").
							</li>
							<li>
								Ceremonial Elements: The baptismal ceremony includes prayers,
								scripture readings, anointing with chrism oil, and the lighting
								of a baptismal candle symbolizing the light of Christ.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Infant Baptism</h2>

						<p>
							Catholicism practices infant baptism based on the belief that:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Original Sin: Baptism removes the stain of original sin
								inherited from Adam and Eve, thus restoring the infant to a
								state of grace and making them a child of God.
							</li>
							<li>
								Family and Community: Infant baptism incorporates the child into
								the faith community, with parents and godparents promising to
								raise the child in the Catholic faith.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Effects of Baptism</h2>

						<p>The sacrament of baptism brings about spiritual effects:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Forgiveness of Sin: Baptism forgives all personal sins and the
								punishment due to sin, including original sin.
							</li>
							<li>
								New Life in Christ: Baptism imparts sanctifying grace, the
								theological virtues (faith, hope, and charity), and the gifts of
								the Holy Spirit, enabling the baptized person to live as a
								disciple of Christ.
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Lifelong Commitment</h2>

						<p>Baptism marks the beginning of a lifelong journey of faith:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Faith Formation: Baptized individuals are called to grow in
								faith through ongoing catechesis, participation in the
								sacraments, and active engagement in the life of the Church.
							</li>
							<li>
								Mission and Witness: Baptism empowers the baptized to bear
								witness to Christ in the world, living out their baptismal
								promises through acts of love, service, and evangelization.
							</li>
						</ol>
