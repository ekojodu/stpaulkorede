								ANOINTING OF THE SICK - A Sacrament of Healing and Comfort
							</h2>
							<p>
								In the Catholic tradition, the sacrament of the anointing of the
								sick holds profound significance, offering spiritual strength
								and comfort to those facing illness or suffering. Rooted in
								biblical teachings and centuries of sacred tradition, this
								sacrament serves as a tangible expression of God's mercy, love,
								and presence in times of physical and emotional distress.
							</p>
							<p>
								The sacrament of the anointing of the sick stands as a powerful
								reminder of God's presence and grace in times of illness and
								suffering. It is a sacrament of healing, consolation, and hope,
								offering spiritual strength and comfort to those in need. Rooted
								in scripture and tradition, it continues to be a source of
								solace and support for believers as they navigate the
								complexities of human frailty and mortality, trusting in the
								promise of God's unfailing love and mercy.
							</p>
							<h2>Biblical Foundation</h2>
							<p>
								The practice of anointing the sick finds its roots in the New
								Testament, particularly in the Epistle of James, where it is
								written: "Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of
								the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the
								name of the Lord" (James 5:14, NIV). This passage reflects the
								early Christian community's belief in the power of prayer and
								the use of oil as a symbol of healing and the presence of the
								Holy Spirit.
							</p>
							<h2>Sacramental Rite</h2>
							<p>
								In the Catholic Church, the anointing of the sick is
								administered by a priest or bishop through the laying on of
								hands and the anointing with blessed oil. The sacrament is
								typically accompanied by prayers for healing, forgiveness, and
								spiritual strength. Through this ritual, the person receiving
								the sacrament is invited to entrust their suffering to God and
								to experience the healing grace of Christ in a profound way.
							</p>
							<h2>Purpose and Effects</h2>
							<p>
								The primary purpose of the anointing of the sick is spiritual
								healing and comfort, rather than solely physical cure. It offers
								solace to those who are seriously ill, undergoing surgery, or
								facing the frailty of old age. The sacrament brings the presence
								of Christ to the sick person, strengthening them in their faith
								and offering the assurance of God's love and compassion in their
								time of need.
							</p>
							<h2>Communal Dimension</h2>
							<p>
								While the sacrament is often administered individually, it also
								has a communal dimension. The faith community, represented by
								the priest or minister, gathers around the sick person in prayer
								and solidarity, affirming their interconnectedness and shared
								journey of faith. This communal aspect of the sacrament
								underscores the importance of mutual support and care within the
								Body of Christ.
							</p>
							<h2>Hope and Trust in God</h2>
							<p>
								In the face of illness and suffering, the anointing of the sick
								instills hope and trust in God's providential care. It reminds
								believers that they are not alone in their struggles but are
								held in the embrace of a loving and compassionate God. Through
								the grace of this sacrament, they are invited to surrender their
								fears and anxieties to God and to find strength and peace in the
								midst of their challenges.
