							<h2>CONFIRMATION - Empowered by Faith, Sealed with the Spirit</h2>
							<p>
								The Catholic Church sacrament of Confirmation, often described
								as the sacrament of empowerment, holds significant spiritual
								importance for believers. Rooted in biblical tradition and
								enriched by centuries of theological development, Confirmation
								marks a pivotal moment in the journey of faith for Catholics
								worldwide.
							</p>
							<p>
								The sacrament of Confirmation is a sacred milestone in the life
								of a Catholic, marking the moment when they receive the fullness
								of the Holy Spirit and embrace their role as active members of
								the Church. With its rich theological significance and
								transformative grace, Confirmation empowers believers to live
								out their faith with courage, conviction, and compassion,
								embodying the spirit of Pentecost in their daily lives.
							</p>
							<h2>Origins and Significance</h2>
							<p>
								Confirmation finds its origins in the early Christian Church,
								where it was closely associated with the outpouring of the Holy
								Spirit upon believers. The Acts of the Apostles narrates the
								Apostles laying hands on new believers, imparting the gifts of
								the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:14-17). Over time, the sacrament
								evolved, solidifying its place as one of the seven sacraments
								instituted by Christ Himself.
							</p>
							<h2>Sacramental Rite</h2>
							<p>
								The sacrament of Confirmation typically occurs after Baptism and
								the reception of First Holy Communion, completing the process
								known as the Sacraments of Initiation. During the rite, the
								confirmands (those to be confirmed) renew their baptismal vows
								and are anointed with chrism oil by the bishop or priest,
								symbolizing the seal of the Holy Spirit.
							</p>
							<h2>Theological Understanding</h2>
							<p>
								Confirmation is viewed as the sacrament in which the baptized
								are more perfectly bound to the Church and are enriched with a
								special strength of the Holy Spirit. This strengthening prepares
								them to profess their faith boldly and live it out in the world.
								The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit – wisdom, understanding,
								counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord – are
								imparted during Confirmation, empowering individuals to live
								virtuous lives and serve God and others faithfully.
							</p>
							<h2>Role in the Christian Life</h2>
							<p>
								Confirmation is not merely a rite of passage but a call to
								active discipleship. It equips believers with spiritual tools to
								navigate the challenges of life and witness to Christ's love and
								truth. Through Confirmation, Catholics are initiated into full
								participation in the Church's mission, called to be active
								members of the Body of Christ and share in its evangelizing
								work.
							</p>
							<h2>Preparation and Celebration</h2>
							<p>
								Preparation for Confirmation involves catechesis, prayer, and
								reflection, often undertaken in conjunction with a period of
								spiritual formation. The sacrament is typically celebrated with
								reverence and joy within the faith community, with family and
								friends gathered to support and celebrate the confirmands'
								commitment to their faith journey.
